# Duel
Made by School group Prometheus Studio, team of 5. 
We consist of 3 programmers 2 artists.
We use opengl, specifically glut and glew.
We also use a bit of fmod for sound managing.
Music is not original, however sounds are mostly orginial.
Project done over the span of sept 2017- april 2018

Run in 86 bit instead of 64 bit (caused by fmod api)
